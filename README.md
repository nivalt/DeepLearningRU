# Deep Learning RU Course

This repository contains exercises and projects completed as part of the Deep Learning course at Reichman University. The course covers various topics in deep learning, including:

- Neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks
- Recurrent neural networks
- Generative models
- Reinforcement learning

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises and projects in this repository, you will need to have Anaconda installed on your machine. Once you have Anaconda installed, you can create a new conda environment using the `environment.yml` file in the `environment-setup` directory:

```
conda env create -f environment-setup/DL-env.yml
```

This will create a new conda environment called `dl_env` with all the necessary dependencies for running the exercises and projects in this repository.

To activate the `dl_env` environment, run:

```
conda activate dl_env
```

Once you have activated the environment, you can run the exercises and projects by navigating to the relevant directory and running the Python files.

For more information on setting up the conda environment, see the `environment-setup` directory.
